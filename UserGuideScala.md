# Spark ROOT User Guide

**Current Release available on Maven Central is 0.1.7**

## Requirements
- Apache Spark 2.0 and above
- Scala 2.11
- hdfs 

Comment: hdfs is required for now even for local testing. The ROOT file can reside on local system, hdfs will fall back on local file system if you specify the proper redirector(URI) file:/path/to/file. This requirement will be lifted in later versions

## Data
Data that is used in this guide can either be copied locally (from specified location) or
is available on hdfs at CERN. 

- /afs/cern.ch/work/v/vkhriste/public/spark-root-testdata
- hdfs:/cms/bigdatasci/vkhriste/data

All of the test files used/shown are available from the above locations

## Instructions
- It is assumed that the user conforms to the requirements.
- std out spark logging might differ based on 2.0 or 2.1 spark versions 

## Example Higgs -> 2 muons Analysis

First example comes from Higgs to Dimuon Analysis. Since this was the very first test of the ability to process stl containers, we include this example here. ROOT files come from the CMS Higgs Analysis. 

This example contains:
- STL Containers of Composite Classes
- Composites with other nested Composites  

```
you start by running spark shell, spark-root is hosted on maven central
./spark-shell --packages org.diana-hep:spark-root_2.11:0.1.7

you have to import the implicit ROOT DataFrameReader
import org.dianahep.sparkroot._

as simple as reading in parquet or avro
scala> val df = spark.sqlContext.read.root("file:/Users/vk/software/Analysis/files/test/ntuple_drellyan_test.root")

if you want to get the schema
scala> df.printSchema

simply read in the first few entries
scala> df.show

## Example CMSSW AOD - public Dataset 

We include this example as this is the one that will be used for producing benchmarks.
It comes from the public CMS dataset from 2010, http://opendata.cern.ch/record/10

Half of the whole dataset (~1.2TB) is available on CERN's hdfs at the location indicated above. 

```
again, assume the same commands up to importing ROOT DataFrame Reader

Note1: we specify the tree
Note2: we give a folder that has subfolders,files inside. SPARK-ROOT recursively searches for ROOT files inside of the folder specified.
scala> val df = spark.sqlContext.read.option("tree", "Events").root("hdfs:/cms/bigdatasci/vkhriste/data/publiccms_muionia_aod")

here is the pt for muons for the first 20 events
